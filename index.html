        <h2 id="aboutMeHeading">About me</h2>
        <p id="bio">My name is Caleb Murugan, I have a degree in Computer Science and Information Technology which I acquired with a dean's commendation.
            I am ardent about computer science as it's an industry that is always changing and progressing. I find the different ways we can 
            solve the same problem in computer science through different languages, systems, stacks and api's fascinating and is a big motivation 
            for me to never stop learning. When I'm not coding I spend my time doing my favourite second hobby; reading. I love suprising people with my work. Ever since I wrote my first "Hello World" program and showed it 
            to my peers, their shock and excitment at what my (very simple) program could do has driven me to <i>keep creating</i>, <i>keep learning</i> and <i>keep 
            suprising</i>.

        <p id="education">
            I matriculated from Glenwood Boys Highschool in 2018 with Colors (aggregate above 75) and an award in Accounting. I had applied to 
            UKZN for various degrees including BCom, Engineering and Computer Science. While I had a choice of all options I decided to take a leap 
            and go with Computer Science. To my suprise I enjoyed studying the degree greatly and in three years I completed it with a dean's commendation 
            for excellence. I now further my skills by taking only courses in languages and software not included in my degree to increase my presence 
            as a full stack developer in computer Science.
